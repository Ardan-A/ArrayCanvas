# ArrayCanvas
Graphics rendering class that allows for more advanced storage and manipulation of graphics through Canvas and JPanels (what ACanvas is based off of)

The idea here is to create a more intuitive way to do graphics and eventually create animations through simply calling methods on an ACanvas, and all of that on an open source platform that allows for open development of a tool made by and through its community. 


Current Defined Progression of this program: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1.0 :  Storage
- Store and manipulate Canvas and ACanvas in LinkedLists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working on: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1.5 : 
- Order Canvases and ACanvases automatically and by user distinction

Level 2.0 :  Basic Animation
- Develope a way to bend single Canvas or ACanvas graphics

Level 2.5 : 
- Bend ACanvases concurrently with it's constituents 

Level 3.0 :  Simple Rendering
- Quickly render graphics when finalize() is called 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future Plans:
- Stacked animation features where animations are called within ACanvas to create more complex ones
- Animation options to allow for a larger variety of shapes for things to bend into 
- Allow for animations based on input equations (Bend graphics to a certain line, change orientation, ect)
- Threaded Rendering to allow for multiple animations at once
- Optimized Threaded Rendering to allow for faster rendering
- Rendering Options to allow for different ways to load graphics and animations for different use cases
